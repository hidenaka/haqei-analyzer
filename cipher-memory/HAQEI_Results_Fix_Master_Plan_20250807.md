# HAQEI Results Fix - Master Plan Summary

Date: 2025-08-07 JST | Status: Implementation Ready | Priority: HIGH

## Problem Analysis
Current emergency bypass displays crude inline results vs. existing beautiful Chart.js system in os_analyzer_results.html

## Solution Strategy  
Redirect from 30-question completion → os_analyzer_results.html with localStorage data transfer

## Implementation Plan
1. **Data Transfer**: 30-question answers → localStorage JSON format
2. **Page Redirect**: window.location.href to results page  
3. **Results Loading**: os_analyzer_results.html reads localStorage data
4. **Chart.js Display**: Beautiful visualization using existing system
5. **Data Cleanup**: Remove localStorage after display

## Technical Specs
- localStorage format: {source:'emergency_bypass', answers:[], scores:{}}
- Error handling: Fallback to inline display if transfer fails
- Performance: <500ms transition, <2s chart rendering
- Testing: Full MCP validation of 30-question → results flow

## Quality Improvement
- Restored: Beautiful Chart.js visualizations
- Restored: Detailed I-Ching analysis content  
- Improved: CSS consistency and stability
- Improved: Error resilience and maintenance

## Success Metrics
✅ 30-question flow → beautiful results page
✅ Chart.js graphs display correctly  
✅ No CSS layout issues
✅ MCP validation passes 100%

Implementation time: ~55 minutes with full testing and validation.
