# SPARC Development System

## SPARC Development Commands

### Core SPARC Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc modes`: List all available SPARC development modes
- `npx claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"`: Execute specific SPARC mode for a task
- `npx claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"`: Run complete TDD workflow using SPARC methodology
- `npx claude-flow sparc info <mode>`: Get detailed information about a specific mode

### Batchtools Commands (Optimized)
- `npx claude-flow sparc batch <modes> "<task>"`: Execute multiple SPARC modes in parallel
- `npx claude-flow sparc pipeline "<task>"`: Execute full SPARC pipeline with parallel processing
- `npx claude-flow sparc concurrent <mode> "<tasks-file>"`: Process multiple tasks concurrently

## SPARC Methodology Workflow (Batchtools Enhanced)

### 1. Specification Phase (Parallel Analysis)
```bash
npx claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Define user authentication requirements" --parallel
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Simultaneously analyze multiple requirement sources, validate constraints in parallel, and generate comprehensive specifications.

### 2. Pseudocode Phase (Concurrent Logic Design)
```bash
npx claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode" --batch-optimize
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Process multiple algorithm patterns concurrently, validate logic flows in parallel, and optimize data structures simultaneously.

### 3. Architecture Phase (Parallel Component Design)
```bash
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture" --parallel
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Generate multiple architectural alternatives simultaneously, validate integration points in parallel, and create comprehensive documentation concurrently.

### 4. Refinement Phase (Parallel TDD Implementation)
```bash
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system" --batch-tdd
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Generate multiple test scenarios simultaneously, implement and validate code in parallel, and optimize performance concurrently.

### 5. Completion Phase (Concurrent Integration)
```bash
npx claude-flow sparc run integration "integrate authentication with user management" --parallel
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Run integration tests in parallel, generate documentation concurrently, and validate requirements simultaneously.

## Batchtools Integration Features

### Parallel Processing Capabilities
- **Concurrent File Operations**: Read, analyze, and modify multiple files simultaneously

## Code Style and Best Practices (Batchtools Enhanced)

### SPARC Development Principles with Batchtools
- **Modular Design**: Keep files under 500 lines, optimize with parallel analysis
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets, validate with concurrent checks
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation using parallel generation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns with concurrent validation
- **Parallel Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation with concurrent updates
