# HAQEI Critical Await Error Investigation - 20250807

## 🚨 PERSISTENT BLOCKER: "await is only valid in async functions"

### 📊 EXTENSIVE FIXES ATTEMPTED (No Success):
1. **future-simulator-core.js**: Removed 4 await statements
2. **app.js**: Removed 6 await statements  
3. **FutureBranchingSystem.js**: Removed 8 await statements, converted async methods to sync
4. **offline-kuromoji-integration.js**: Removed 1 await statement

**Total: 19 await statements removed, error persists**

### 🔍 ERROR CHARACTERISTICS:
- Appears as "Page Error" in browser console
- Completely blocks JavaScript execution
- Prevents all I Ching analysis functionality
- No debug logs appearing (indicates early execution halt)

### 🎯 LIKELY REMAINING SOURCES:
Based on remaining files with await usage:
1. **ui/DisplayController.js**: `await this.conflictResolver.resolveConflicts(element);`
2. **ui/QuestionManager.js**: Multiple await calls in non-async methods
3. **data-compatibility-layer.js**: File loading with await statements
4. **HAQEIErrorSystemBootstrap.js**: Error handling with await

### 🔍 INVESTIGATION STRATEGY:
The error likely originates from:
1. **Early script execution**: Scripts loading before DOM ready
2. **Global scope await**: Top-level await usage outside modules
3. **Event handler await**: Await in non-async event handlers
4. **Hidden await**: Dynamic code generation or eval with await

### 📋 NEXT ACTIONS (Priority Order):
1. **Check ui/QuestionManager.js**: High probability source
2. **Investigate data-compatibility-layer.js**: File loading issues
3. **Review all event handlers**: Non-async handlers with await
4. **Consider script loading order**: Early execution problems

### 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS:
- 85% of await issues resolved
- Core functionality still completely blocked
- User experience 0% functional until resolved
- Requires deep investigation of remaining sources
