# HAQEI Final Validation Critical Error - 20250807
Date: 20250807
Status: Critical Issue Identified

## Critical Error Analysis:
The final user experience validation test is consistently failing with:
1. `ReferenceError: IChingFutureSimulator is not defined`
2. `await is only valid in async functions` errors

## Root Cause:
The IChingFutureSimulator class is not being loaded properly despite the script being included. This is a script loading order or timing issue.

## Architecture Context:
- H384 Database: Working (386 entries loaded)
- System Functions: getIChingSimulator available  
- I Ching Section: Displaying correctly
- Problem: Class definition not accessible when DOMContentLoaded fires

## Critical Impact:
- User cannot see hexagram results
- Theme selection not working (0 options)
- Database connection failing despite data being loaded
- Complete I Ching functionality broken

## Immediate Action Required:
Need to fix script loading order or add proper class availability checks before initialization.

## Success Criteria:
- Hexagram display works
- Theme options appear (3 expected)
- Database connection succeeds
- No critical JavaScript errors

## Status: URGENT FIX NEEDED
The I Ching integration system is completely non-functional despite all previous fixes being applied.
