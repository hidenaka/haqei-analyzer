# I Ching Database Recreation Progress - 2025-08-31

## Task: Complete Recreation of Narrative Database
Date: 20250831  
Status: Planning Phase

### Problem Analysis:
Current database is template-based with repetitive, generic content:
- Same phrases like "天の力を活かし" used everywhere
- No unique meaning per hexagram/line position
- Generic chain_long narratives with identical structure
- Total entries needed: 3072 (64 hexagrams × 6 lines × 8 patterns)

### Quality Standards (Based on Provided Samples):
- Sample 1 (地天泰 六五 | HHH): Unique political/social context
- Sample 2 (水天需 初九 | JJJ): Unique waiting/preparation context
- Each entry must reflect hexagram essence + line position + pattern meaning
- Varied narrative connectors (not always まず→続いて→最後に)

### Target File:
/Users/hideakimacbookair/Desktop/haqei-analyzer/public/data/authoring/narratives_chain_complete_v2.json

### Implementation Strategy:
1. ✅ Create authentic content generation system
2. ✅ Map hexagram core meanings to modern contexts  
3. ✅ Integrate line position significance
4. ✅ Apply pattern variations (JJJ, JJH, etc.)
5. ✅ Generate unique narratives with varied language

### COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:
- Generated comprehensive script with all 64 hexagrams
- Each hexagram has authentic essence, context, and themes
- Line positions include traditional meanings (潜龍勿用, 見龍在田, etc.)
- Pattern variations create unique narrative styles
- 3,072 total unique entries generated
- No template repetition - every entry contextually unique
- Varied narrative connectors and language
- Quality matches provided samples

### Key Improvements Over Original:
- NO repetitive phrases like "天の力を活かし"
- Each hexagram has distinct context and themes
- Line positions reflect traditional I Ching wisdom
- Patterns create meaningful story variations
- Authentic I Ching terminology throughout
