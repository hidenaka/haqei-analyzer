## Task: Complete Database Rebuild with 3072 Unique Entries
Date: 2025-08-31
Status: In Progress

### Problem Analysis:
- Current database has only 48 unique patterns repeated across 3072 entries
- Users need EACH entry to be completely unique with specific hexagram + line + pattern meaning
- NO template repetition or generic phrases allowed

### Architecture Approach:
- 64 hexagrams × 6 lines × 8 patterns = 3072 unique combinations
- Each entry must reflect specific hexagram meaning + line position role + pattern progression
- Generate authentic content based on I-Ching principles
