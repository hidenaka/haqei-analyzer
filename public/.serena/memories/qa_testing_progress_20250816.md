# QA Testing Session: OSAnalyzer Integration Issues Verification
Date: 20250816
Status: In Progress

## Test Objectives:
Verify resolution of three critical integration issues:
1. I1: 分析開始ボタン→質問画面遷移 - Fixed by modifying startAnalysis() method to use ScreenManager.switchToAccessible('question')
2. I2: 質問進行フロー次の質問ボタン有効化 - Fixed by updating showQuestion() method to use window.QUESTIONS (36-question system) instead of local QUESTIONS (8-question system)  
3. I3: JavaScriptエラー'Unexpected token if' - Fixed by adding proper checks for window.QUESTIONS existence and removing extra closing brace

## Test Plan:
1. Load OSAnalyzer HTML file
2. Console error check (JavaScript validation)
3. UI flow testing (welcome → questions → analysis)
4. Question system validation (36 vs 8 questions)
5. Integration success assessment
