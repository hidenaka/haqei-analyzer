# Requirements Document

## Introduction

analyzer.html において HAQEI_DATA が見つからないエラーが発生し、アプリケーションの初期化が失敗している問題を解決する。この問題は以前のバグ修正後に発生しており、データ読み込み機能の修復が必要である。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analyzer.html to load successfully without critical data errors, so that I can use the HAQEI analysis functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzer.html is loaded THEN the system SHALL successfully locate and load HAQEI_DATA
2. WHEN DataManager.loadData() is called THEN the system SHALL not throw "Critical data missing: HAQEI_DATA not found" error
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL complete initialization without data loading failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for missing data sources, so that I can identify and resolve data loading issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HAQEI_DATA is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific missing data source
2. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the failure cause
3. IF alternative data sources are available THEN the system SHALL attempt to use fallback data sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures, so that previously working functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads data THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing HAQEI data format
2. WHEN accessing hexagram data THEN the system SHALL provide the same data structure as before the bug fix
3. IF data format has changed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate data transformation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the data loading fix doesn't break other parts of the system, so that I can ensure system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data loading fix is applied THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work without regression
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN all previously passing tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN the system is fully loaded THEN performance SHALL not be significantly degraded
