# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HaQei Analyzer の analyzer.html で発生している MIME タイプエラーによるスクリプト読み込み問題を解決する必要があります。現在、すべての JavaScript ファイルが「text/html; charset=utf-8」として配信されており、これによりスクリプトの正常な読み込みが阻害されています。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JavaScript files to be served with the correct MIME type, so that the analyzer application loads properly without MIME type warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript files (.js) are requested THEN the server SHALL serve them with MIME type "application/javascript" or "text/javascript"
2. WHEN the PathValidation system checks script paths THEN it SHALL not report MIME type errors for JavaScript files
3. WHEN the analyzer.html loads THEN all script files SHALL be loaded without MIME type warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ScriptPathValidator to handle MIME type validation gracefully, so that it provides useful feedback without overwhelming the console with errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MIME type validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN multiple files have the same MIME type issue THEN the system SHALL group similar errors together
3. WHEN MIME type issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for resolution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to continue functioning even when MIME type issues are present, so that development can continue while server configuration is being fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MIME type errors occur THEN the application SHALL still attempt to load and execute scripts
2. WHEN script loading fails due to MIME types THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN MIME type warnings are present THEN they SHALL not prevent the application from initializing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation on how to configure the server properly, so that MIME type issues can be prevented in different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN documentation SHALL be available for common server configurations
2. WHEN using different development servers THEN specific setup instructions SHALL be provided
3. WHEN MIME type issues occur THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL be easily accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error detection system to be more intelligent about MIME type validation, so that it can distinguish between actual errors and configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating script paths THEN the system SHALL differentiate between missing files and MIME type issues
2. WHEN MIME type errors are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific solutions based on the error type
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN MIME type warnings SHALL be less verbose but still informative
