# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to modernize and enhance the quick_analyzer.html system by transforming it from a monolithic single-file application into a modular, professional-grade analyzer that bridges the quality gap with the advanced new-analyzer system. The improvement focuses on architectural modernization, visual quality enhancement, and advanced analysis capabilities while maintaining the simplicity and accessibility that makes the quick analyzer valuable for users seeking fast insights.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the quick analyzer to have a modular architecture, so that the code is maintainable, extensible, and follows modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is structured THEN it SHALL separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files
2. WHEN JavaScript functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL be organized into logical modules and components
3. WHEN data management is required THEN it SHALL use dedicated data management classes
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent component-based architecture
5. IF modifications are needed THEN the modular structure SHALL allow changes without affecting unrelated functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust data handling and error management, so that my analysis experience is reliable and my data is safely managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs before processing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL store them securely using proper storage management
4. WHEN data operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms
5. IF invalid data is encountered THEN the system SHALL prevent system crashes and guide user correction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an engaging and interactive question flow, so that the analysis process feels dynamic and keeps me engaged throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are presented THEN the system SHALL display them in a staged, progressive manner
2. WHEN the user answers questions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN the user progresses through the flow THEN the system SHALL show clear advancement indicators
4. WHEN transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations to enhance the experience
5. IF the user wants to review previous answers THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between questions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced analysis capabilities with visual insights, so that I can better understand my personality profile and receive actionable insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL generate multi-dimensional personality insights
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL include visual charts and graphs using Chart.js
3. WHEN insights are provided THEN the system SHALL offer personalized recommendations and explanations
4. WHEN the user views their profile THEN the system SHALL present detailed breakdowns of personality dimensions
5. IF the user wants to understand their results THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of each insight

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quick analyzer to integrate smoothly with other system components, so that I can have a cohesive experience across different analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is shared between analyzers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency in data formats
2. WHEN the user switches between different analyzers THEN the system SHALL preserve relevant user context
3. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL be compatible with other system components
4. WHEN integration is required THEN the system SHALL use standardized APIs and data structures
5. IF the user accesses multiple analysis tools THEN the system SHALL provide a unified user experience

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the quick analyzer to have optimal performance and maintainability, so that it can scale effectively and be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL optimize loading times through efficient resource management
2. WHEN external libraries are used THEN they SHALL be properly integrated without performance degradation
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns and be well-documented
4. WHEN updates are needed THEN the modular structure SHALL facilitate easy maintenance
5. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide debugging capabilities and error tracking
