# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the HaQei Analyzer's user interface to achieve complete data utilization and interactive design. The goal is to transform the current static display into an engaging, explorable interface where users can seamlessly navigate from surface-level results to detailed analytical insights. This addresses the current issues where valuable analysis data remains hidden and users cannot intuitively discover interactive elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing my Triple OS analysis results, I want to see accurate OS names and scores for all three operating systems (Engine, Interface, Safe Mode), so that I can understand my complete psychological profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Triple OS results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show correct OS names for Engine, Interface, and Safe Mode operating systems
2. WHEN accessing OS data THEN the system SHALL use proper object references like `this.analysisResult.interfaceOS.osName` instead of incorrect references
3. WHEN any OS data is missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content instead of "不明" (unknown)
4. WHEN OS scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL display accurate numerical values for each operating system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user exploring my analysis results, I want to visually identify which elements are interactive, so that I can discover additional information without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing OS cards THEN the system SHALL display expand/collapse icons (+ and ×) in card headers
2. WHEN hovering over interactive cards THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating clickability
3. WHEN a card is expanded THEN the expand icon SHALL rotate to indicate the changed state
4. WHEN a card is collapsed THEN the expand icon SHALL return to its original position
5. IF a card contains expandable content THEN the system SHALL make this visually apparent through design cues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user expanding OS detail cards, I want to see structured, meaningful information about my strengths and growth areas, so that I can gain actionable insights from my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OS card is expanded THEN the system SHALL display "潜在的な強み" (Potential Strengths) as a clearly labeled section
2. WHEN an OS card is expanded THEN the system SHALL display "成長の課題" (Growth Challenges) as a clearly labeled section
3. WHEN displaying strengths and challenges THEN the system SHALL format them as readable lists with proper HTML structure
4. WHEN hexagram details are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful fallback content
5. IF detailed information exists THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from hexagram_details.js data source

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interested in understanding my internal dynamics, I want to interact with the dynamics cards to explore detailed evaluation metrics, so that I can understand the deeper psychological mechanisms at work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the "内なる力学" (Internal Dynamics) section THEN the system SHALL make dynamics cards clickable
2. WHEN clicking a dynamics card THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed evaluation metrics
3. WHEN dynamics details are expanded THEN the system SHALL display five evaluation categories with visual indicators
4. WHEN evaluation metrics are shown THEN the system SHALL include horizontal bar graphs or similar visual representations
5. WHEN dynamics cards are collapsed THEN the system SHALL hide detailed content with smooth animations
6. IF evaluation data is available THEN the system SHALL display metrics for functionality efficiency, adaptability, stability, expression capability, and harmony maintenance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user navigating the enhanced interface, I want smooth, professional animations and transitions, so that the experience feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cards expand or collapse THEN the system SHALL use smooth CSS transitions with appropriate timing
2. WHEN expand icons rotate THEN the system SHALL animate the rotation over 0.4 seconds
3. WHEN content areas change height THEN the system SHALL use max-height transitions for smooth reveals
4. WHEN interactive elements are hovered THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. IF animations are in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicting interactions until completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the enhanced interface to remain accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are added THEN the system SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels
2. WHEN expand/collapse functionality is implemented THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation
3. WHEN visual indicators are used THEN the system SHALL provide text alternatives for screen readers
4. WHEN content is dynamically shown/hidden THEN the system SHALL announce changes to assistive technologies
5. IF color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide additional non-color indicators
