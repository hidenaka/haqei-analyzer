# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在の診断結果表示は横並びカード型レイアウトで情報を比較しやすいが、物語性に欠けている。ユーザーが診断結果を見るとき、自分の「人格 OS」が起動し、解析されていくプロセスを追体験するような流れをデザインすることで、単なる情報の受け取りではなく「発見と驚きのある体験」へと昇華させる。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has completed the personality diagnosis, I want to experience my personality OS booting up in a narrative sequence, so that I feel like I'm discovering my inner workings rather than just reading static information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diagnosis is completed THEN the system SHALL display a boot screen with the primary Engine OS name prominently
2. WHEN the boot screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the hexagram background with subtle animation
3. WHEN the user scrolls down THEN the system SHALL reveal sections in a narrative sequence from top to bottom
4. WHEN each section comes into view THEN the system SHALL animate the content with smooth fade-in effects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing my diagnosis results, I want to see my Core Engine analysis as the most prominent section, so that I understand my fundamental personality drive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Core Engine section is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the Engine OS name with high visual prominence
2. WHEN the Core Engine section is displayed THEN the system SHALL integrate the radar chart as "OS specifications"
3. WHEN core characteristics are shown THEN the system SHALL present them as compelling catchphrases rather than bullet points
4. WHEN detailed information is available THEN the system SHALL hide it behind expandable accordion UI to prevent information overload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user exploring my personality structure, I want to understand how my different OS components interact, so that I can see the relationships between my inner drives and external behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI section is displayed THEN the system SHALL explain the Interface OS as how the Engine OS connects to society
2. WHEN OS dynamics are shown THEN the system SHALL display visual connectors between OS icons
3. WHEN harmony exists between OSs THEN the system SHALL show smooth, connected visual elements
4. WHEN tension exists between OSs THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of conflict or friction
5. WHEN dynamics scores are displayed THEN the system SHALL use animated progress bars or visual metaphors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user learning about my stress responses, I want to understand my Safe Mode OS as a protective system, so that I can recognize my defensive patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Safe Mode section is displayed THEN the system SHALL introduce it as a protective firewall system
2. WHEN Safe Mode dynamics are shown THEN the system SHALL display the relationship with Engine OS
3. WHEN tension is present THEN the system SHALL use visual elements that convey protective but conflicting energy
4. WHEN Safe Mode characteristics are presented THEN the system SHALL frame them in the context of stress response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user completing the OS discovery journey, I want to see how all my OS components work together as different aspects of myself, so that I understand my multifaceted nature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conclusion section is displayed THEN the system SHALL summarize all three OS components
2. WHEN the integration message is shown THEN the system SHALL explain the "bunjin" (multiple selves) philosophy
3. WHEN OS summaries are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them as complementary aspects rather than separate entities
4. WHEN the experience concludes THEN the system SHALL provide clear next actions (sharing, exploring other types)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the OS boot sequence, I want each OS type to have its own visual theme, so that I can distinguish and connect with different aspects of my personality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Engine OS is identified THEN the system SHALL apply a consistent theme color throughout the interface
2. WHEN OS names are highlighted THEN the system SHALL use the theme color for emphasis
3. WHEN charts and graphs are displayed THEN the system SHALL incorporate the theme color
4. WHEN hexagram symbols are shown THEN the system SHALL use them as distinctive visual elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user scrolling through my personality analysis, I want smooth animations and micro-interactions, so that the experience feels like watching my OS actually boot up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections come into viewport THEN the system SHALL trigger fade-in animations
2. WHEN numerical values are displayed THEN the system SHALL animate count-up effects
3. WHEN OS connections are shown THEN the system SHALL animate the connector elements
4. WHEN hexagram backgrounds are displayed THEN the system SHALL show subtle drawing animations
5. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance without lag

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the OS boot sequence to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile, so that I can have the same immersive experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain the vertical scroll narrative structure
2. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt typography and spacing appropriately
3. WHEN animations are triggered THEN the system SHALL perform smoothly on both desktop and mobile
4. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to mobile gestures
5. WHEN the results page loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a Google Core Web Vitals score of "Good" for LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
6. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animation frame rate (ideally 60fps) with low CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) score

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments or motor disabilities, I want to be able to navigate and understand my diagnosis results using assistive technologies, so that I can have the same insightful experience as everyone else.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL have sufficient color contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are fully operable using only keyboard
3. WHEN a screen reader is used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alternative text for images, icons, and charts
4. WHEN animations are present THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reduce or disable motion for users sensitive to it

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user who wants to share my personality OS results, I want to generate compelling social media content that encourages others to try the diagnosis, so that I can share my discovery and help others discover theirs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the share button THEN the system SHALL generate a unique summary image for social media using OGP
2. WHEN the summary image is generated THEN it SHALL include the user's primary OS type, hexagram symbol, and compelling catchphrase
3. WHEN the shared link is accessed THEN it SHALL lead to the diagnosis landing page to encourage new users to take the test
4. WHEN social media previews are displayed THEN they SHALL be visually appealing and clearly communicate the value proposition
