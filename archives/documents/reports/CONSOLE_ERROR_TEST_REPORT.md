## 🚨 Critical Findings

### ✅ No Critical Runtime Errors
- All core dependencies are properly loaded
- Error handling systems are in place
- Web Components are correctly implemented
- Question data is properly structured

### ⚠️ One High-Priority Issue Found

**localStorage Usage in app.js (HIGH)**

## 🧪 Recommended Browser Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Load Test
```bash
# Open browser developer tools (F12)
# Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/os_analyzer.html
# Check Console tab for any red error messages
```

### Step 2: Question Flow Test
1. Start the diagnostic
2. Answer 5-10 questions
3. Monitor console for errors
4. Check Network tab for 404s
5. Verify question display (especially even-numbered questions)

### Step 3: Memory Monitoring
1. Open Performance tab
2. Record memory usage during question flow
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Verify cleanup after completion

### Step 4: Resource Loading Verification
1. Check Network tab during initial load
2. Verify all CSS files load (200 status)
3. Verify all JavaScript files load (200 status)
4. Check for CORS issues

## 🎯 Expected Console Output

### ✅ Normal Operation
```javascript
🎯 HaQei Analyzer starting...
📱 DOM loaded, initializing components...
⚡ MicroStorageManager initialized
📋 Ready for diagnosis!
✅ All components initialized successfully
```

### ⚠️ Potential Warnings (Non-Critical)
```javascript
⚠️ localStorage quota warning (in private browsing)
⚠️ Performance optimization suggestions
ℹ️ Debug information (development mode)
```

### 🚨 Issues Requiring Attention
```javascript
❌ Script loading failures (404 errors)
❌ ReferenceError: [variable] is not defined
❌ TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined
```
